[WOTC] Iridar's Appearance Manager

This mod allows you to:
1. Copy entire or partial soldier appearance from one specific soldier to another, or across entire squad, barracks or character pool.
2. Configure soldier appearance for any armor while in character pool.
3. Set up uniforms that will be automatically applied to soldiers when they equip new armor for the first time.
4. Prevent Character Pool units from losing their saved appearance if you start the game with cosmetic mods temporarily disabled.

This mod adds new functionality to Character Pool and new robust interface to manage units' appearance, as well as an automated soldier uniform system.

[h1]Character Pool Overhaul[/h1]

This mod expands the Character Pool so that Character Pool units can benefit from the game's Appearance Store mechanic. Even without any mods, during the campaign soldiers remember their appearance for each armor they have ever equipped. But this information is lost when the unit is saved to the Character Pool. To fix this, the mod creates Character Pool files of a new, expanded format, in addition to the old one. 

This mod also allows equipping different armors in Character Pool, and customize units' appearance for that specific armor. You can now pre-customize all your soldiers for all armors before you ever start the campaign. 

You can then share these pre-customized soldiers via new Character Pool files.

[h1]Appearance Manager[/h1]

This mod adds a new soldier customization screen. It allows you to select a soldier and then import entire or partial appearance of another unit. You can also make sweeping changes to your entire squad, barracks or character pool. This can be used, for example, to quickly set the same camouflage for the entire squad.

This mod also allows you to preview all stored apperances for the selected unit, and delete some of them. 

[h1]Uniform System[/h1]

This mod allows you to designate specific Character Pool soldiers as uniforms. Then, when a soldier equips an armor they don't have stored appearance for, the mod will automatically copy the uniform's appearance to them. You can also work with uniforms manually using the Manage Appearance screen.

These "uniform soldiers" can also be shared with other people using new Character Pool files.

[h1]Additional Functionality[/h1]

Another big improvement is that this mod can conditionally turn off the apparance validation for character pool units. In the base game, if you start the game without soldier cosmetic mods that were used in your Character Pool units, the game will automatically validate their appearance, by essentially "forgetting" what appearance the units had with those mods. So if you want to turn off your cosmetic mods just so you can test a few things, you would end up ruining your character pool. With this mod you can temporarily disable this validation, allowing your character pool units to preserve their appearance even without cosmetic mods that were required for it. Of course, these units would still be broken, because they will be literally missing body parts, but when you once again enable the cosmetic mods, their appearance will be restored.
